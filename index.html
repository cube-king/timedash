            <p>This project was primarily created as a way to simplify tracking driving time for Driver's Training - customizable goals with a total overall goal
                is exactly what I needed to keep track of my driving time. However, this would also apply to coding time in a manner similar to Hackatime! 
                Anything that can or should be timed can be tracked with Timedash. As well, you can set comprehensive and dynamic goals (such as 2 hours a day,
                15 hours a week, etc) to boost productivity even further!</p>
